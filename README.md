### Dependencies

In this part, you are defining and managing dependencies in your code. Dependencies are external libraries or packages that your project relies on to function correctly. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Defining Your Dependency:

You start by defining your own dependency using the Dependency class.
- groupId: This is a unique identifier for the group or organization that created the dependency.
- artifactId: This is the name of the specific library or package you want to use.
- version: This specifies the version of the dependency you want to use.

Downloading and Loading the Dependency:

- After defining your dependency, you use the `CloudAPI.getDependencyLoader().load()` method to manage it.
- This code checks if the specified dependency is already downloaded. If not, it will download it from a cloud-based repository.
- Once the dependency is downloaded (or if it was already present), it is loaded and made available for your code to use.
In summary, this code allows you to specify and manage external dependencies for your project. It ensures that the required libraries or packages are available and ready to use in your code.

```java
    // definie your own dependency
    var myDependency = new Dependency("groupId", "artifactId", "version");

    // downloading the dependency if not already downloaded and loading it
    CloudAPI.getDependencyLoader().load(myDependency);
```
